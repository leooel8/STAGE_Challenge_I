# STAGE_CARREFOUR_Challenge_I
  Challenge I : Create a 'Hello Word' using technologies found on the Tech Radar  This challenge consists on creating a 'Hello word' program based on tehcnologies found on the Tech Radar. As a Hello Word, I chose to create a basic nodejs program the purpose of which is to transfer a message in the IOTA tangle. IOTA’s Tangle is an open, feeless and scalable distributed ledger, designed to support frictionless data and value transfer.  The challenge also mentions to make this program build automatically, and to push it through the cloud.  For the build part, I will use Docker, and for the could part, I will use AWS.
